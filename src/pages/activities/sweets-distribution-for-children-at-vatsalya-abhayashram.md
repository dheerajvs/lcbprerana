Children residing at Vatsalya Abhayashrama were distributed sweets on the occasion of one of our club members birthday. As it was a weekend and all children were at leisure enjoying their holiday dancing and singing, they were over whelmed with our visit distributing sweets. Was very delighted to hear them sign songs for us that they had newly learnt.

Its always been a pleasure visiting them often.

Children at Ragigudda anganwadi were provided slates and chalk piece to practice writing. The children were so exited to receive the slates and came back for additional chalk pieces. They just could not stop scribbling. These slates can be reused by any number of children for a longer duration if maintained well. 

For the ease of teaching to write, the teacher was provided a black board. 

This way we can save notebooks and paper which children waste by just scribbling most of the time. Let all of us find means to reduce waste and use reusable materials.

We also provided sleeping mats that can be used by children to sleep at noon.

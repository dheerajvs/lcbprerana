As the Ganesha festival was on 31st of August, President of LCB Prerana Sowmya B.A. conducted an eco-friendly Ganesha making workshop using kitchen ingredients for members of LCB Prerana and LCB BTM Nightingale. It was very much appreciated and enjoyed by members of both the clubs. The concept behind this workshop was to save environment, save soil.

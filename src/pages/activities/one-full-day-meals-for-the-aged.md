One full day meals was arranged and served for the aged at OmAshram Trust, where 45 aged residents reside with 10 helpers. The residents were very happy to be served with a festive meal on the occasion of Krishna Janmashtami. 

It was saddening to see the aged without family. 

The members have found a good home, the founders and the care takers are doing a really good job by taking at most care with a full time nurse and a doctor visiting the old age home twice a week. The premises is well maintained. Hats off to the founders and the care takers.

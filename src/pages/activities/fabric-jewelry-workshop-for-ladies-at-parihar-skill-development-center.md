Lions Club of Bangalore Prerana is supporting Parihar Skill Development Center in conducting skill development programs.

As part of this initiative, we conducted “Fabric Jewelry Workshop” for the ladies who are under going tailoring training program at Parihar. “Fabric Jewelry Workshop” will complement the tailoring training program.

During the workshop, the ladies were briefed about various types of jewelry making and techniques of making different kinds of fabric jewelry. The ladies were very enthusiastic and have made plans on perusing fabric jewelry making as their part time carrier. We look forward to seeing their produce in the market.

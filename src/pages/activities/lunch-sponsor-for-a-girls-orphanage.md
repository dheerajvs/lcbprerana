The children residing at Saraswathi Educational & Charitable Trust (R) are between 6 to 12 years of age. 2 of the children are of single parent and the remaining 18 are completely orphans. 

It was heart breaking to see these young children staying with such minimal infrastructural facilities. 

I﻿f, each of us could virtually adopt a child and facilitate them with basic minimalistic needs, it would be a real noble service to the society. 

T﻿he children loved to see us visiting them and said they look forward to us spending time with them over the weekends.

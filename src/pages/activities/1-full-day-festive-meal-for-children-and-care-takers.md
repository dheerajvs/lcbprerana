This event is being sponsored by one of our club members who wished to celebrate her grand daughter's birthday by sponsoring a festive meals for the orphan children.

Children were also given a steel plate, bowl, spoon and a tumbler each. This was sponsored by another member of our club who wanted ban usage of plastic utensils at the orphanage. 

They were very happy tp receive the new utensils. The joy of getting something new was very obvious and it was a pleasure for us to see them happy.

This event was sponsored by one of our club members who wished to celebrate her grand daughter's birthday by sponsoring a special meal for orphan children. We were very happy, when some children asked for another vada and second round of serving.

Children were also given a steel plate, bowl, spoon and a tumbler each. This was sponsored by another member of our club, who wanted to **avoid usage of plastic utensils** at the orphanage. The joy of getting something new was evident on these children's faces.

This event was sponsored by one of our club members who wished to celebrate her grand daughter's birthday by sponsoring a festive meal for the orphan children. We were very happy, when some children asked for another vada and second round of serving.

Children were also given a steel plate, bowl, spoon and a tumbler each. This was sponsored by another member of our club, who wanted to ***ban usage of plastic utensils*** at the orphanage.

They were very happy to receive the new utensils. The joy of getting something new was very obvious on these children's face. We enjoyed the pleasure of seeing these children happy.

The National Council of Women in India (NCWI) Bangalore chapter is working towards upliftment of the underprivileged women and children. Lions Club of Bangalore Prerana is supporting them in conducting skill development programs.

As part of this initiative, we conducted "Fabric Jewelry Workshop" for the ladies who are under going tailoring training program at NCWI. "Fabric Jewelry Workshop" will complement the tailoring training program, these ladies are undergoing. 

During the workshop, the ladies were briefed about various types of jewelry making and techniques of making different kinds of fabric jewelry. The ladies were very enthusiastic and have made plans on perusing fabric jewelry making as their part time carrier. We look forward to seeing their produce in the market.

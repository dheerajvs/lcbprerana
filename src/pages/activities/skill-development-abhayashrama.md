Skill development workshop was conducted for the children at Vatsalya Abhayashrama. A total of 28 children participated in this workshop. They were taught the below listed, during the workshop.

1. ***Warli painting*** was chosen for the workshop, as it is an Indian traditional folk art and the ideas can easily be painted by anyone using basic geometric shapes like: circle, triangle and square. A briefing about ***Indian traditional folk art "Warli painting"*** was given to the children, along with sample greeting cards. The sample greeting cards depicted various issues like *"Stop spitting", "Do not Drink and Drive", "Save trees and plant more trees", "Do not litter and pollute"* etc. They were asked to draw their social life and how they would like to see the surroundings on a greeting card. The results were amazing which depicted childhood, friendship, air pollution, waste segregation, festival, travel etc.
2. The children were taught two different forms of envelope making, so that they can make their own creative, pretty looking envelops for their greeting cards, these envelops can also be used for official correspondence when needed.
3. The children were also taught to make wrist bands on demand.

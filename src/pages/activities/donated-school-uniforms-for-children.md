Children staying at Vatsalya Abhayashrama were given new school uniforms. It was indeed a pleasure to have witnessed such sweet smiles on their innocent faces receiving their new school uniform sets.

The uniforms were distributed by one of our club members children. This way the children learn sharing, giving and caring for the needy at early age of their life.

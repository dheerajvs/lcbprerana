The children at Abhayashrama were attending summer camp during their vacation. Lions Club of Bangalore Prerana conducted couple of skill development workshops for these children. After the end of workshop, we distributed fruits and snacks for the children. The children were so delighted to receive ***biscuits, sweets and fruits***. They quickly started to plan taking with them to their field trip to *chocolates factory* planned post lunch. They decided to eat it on their way. It was like a perfect treat for their picnic that day. It was such a pleasure to watch the happy faces.

Lions Club of Bangalore Prerana has adopted Ragigudda Slum-1 anganwadi with an intention to give better infrastructural needs for the children and women coming from below poverty line. The exterior wall of the anganwadi is painted with the name plate and the ICDS goals and the internal walls are painted with pre-school education material and stories. This being a signature project, the Lions Club logo with the club name is painted on one of the internal walls of the anganwadi. This anganwadi will be used by all the residents staying in that slum and around.

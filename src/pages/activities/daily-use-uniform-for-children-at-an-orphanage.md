These children staying here are mostly orphans or coming form low economic background. They cannot afford clothes for daily use during their stay at the orphanage. Providing uniform ensures their basic clothing need is taken care and are always clean, presentable and un discriminated.

The children were very happy to receive new clothes and they could not wait to change on the spot.

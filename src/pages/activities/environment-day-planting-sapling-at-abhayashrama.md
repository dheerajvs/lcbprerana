Planting of fruits, vegetables and flower saplings in the premises of Vatsalya Abhayashrama was taken up on account of "World Environment Day" celebrations. This place has 25 orphan girls between the age of 4-16years and around 35 children at Mamatha Sishu Mandira, a day care for children of daily waged workers and those of single parents.

The children can enjoy the beauty of nature with greenery, fruits, vegetables and flowers growing around them in the garden and get fresh cool air. Relish eating the organic fruits and vegetables directly by plucking from the plants. 

We planted totally 33 saplings:

* 6 Hibiscus saplings
* 2 Jasmine saplings
* 2 Nandibatlu saplings
* 4 Pentas saplings
* 2 Geranium saplings
* 1 Sweet lemon saplings
* 1 Pomegranate saplings
* 3 Guava saplings
* 2 Custard apple saplings
* 2 Sapota saplings
* 1 Pomegranate saplings
* 2 Mango saplings
* 2 Drumsticks saplings
* 2 Papaya saplings
* 1 Neem sapling

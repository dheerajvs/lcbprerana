June being the mango season, we decided to distribute fresh mangoes to children at Mamatha Sishu Mandira. The children were happy to receive one full uncut ripened mangoes. Though they had finished their snacks, they didn't want to keep the mangoes aside to eat it later. We were over whelmed to have distributed mangoes. 

We believe in cultivating habit of eating all varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables among children at a young age.

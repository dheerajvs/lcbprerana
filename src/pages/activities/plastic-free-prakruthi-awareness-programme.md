“Plastic Free Prakruthi” is an awareness programme that educates youth to be responsible citizens and protect our environment. By keeping surroundings clean and safe, we create a better place for all life on Earth.

Programme components

* 🎬 Movie screening – My Responsibilities
* ✍ Assignment: children share the message with parents, siblings, neighbours, and friends
* ♻ Dry‑ and wet‑waste segregation at home

Through this initiative, young people become ambassadors of change in their own communities.

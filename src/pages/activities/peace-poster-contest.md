Peace Poster Contest was conducted for children aged between 11 to 13 years of age. Children were provided Paper, Pencil, Eraser, Scale, Sharper and Wax Crayons. The children thoroughly enjoyed participating in this competition, where they were to put in a lot of thought on the topic **"Lead with Compassion".** Children expressed their compassion by extending their support towards keeping their nature clean, plating saplings and nurturing them, helping the blind, aged, disabled etc.
